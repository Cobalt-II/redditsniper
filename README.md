2 puppeteer bots for Reddit for registering accounts and either upvoting or downvoting posts.
How to use:
Install Puppeteer with npm install puppeteer. 
From there execute the registerbot after you've filled in the variables for the registerbot (password, email). Note: the registerbot is almost fully automatic except for the captcha at the end, which you need to manually solve. The console will log the name of your new account. Make sure to copy these names.
From there, enter the names into the sniperbot accounts, and enter the password you used for the registerbot as the password for the sniperbot.
